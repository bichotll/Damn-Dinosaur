##Brainstorming
 - Project approach
 	- Brainstorming and check references and possible applications
 	- Create the documentation of EVERYTHING (marketing strategy, definition and design of the project...) and organize how and with what we will develop it.
 		- Check the resources needed and find them (workers, people, tools...)
 	- Publish this documentation
 	- Begin the first marketing strategy
 	- Begin the crowdfunding (KickStarter)
 		- Enough to pay the project, workers' hours, resources needed...
 		- Let's say min 1200â‚¬/month per worker?
 	- If it success begin the project, if not fire the dinosaur (again)
 	- Project announcement
 	- Create a company to apply the idea
 		- Free application of the project to some ONG/City hall.
 		- Create a nice price pack and invest some of the money for other non-paid projects.
With this we will have paid the time that it will take us to get done the project, the workers...and then 

 - Marketing
 	- For the first steps
 		- Find associations and even parties to support us and announce the crowdfunding
 	- Create CrowdFunding
 	- Find a hosting company to support the necesities like the first demo (CDmon? I have contacts).

 - Idea
 	- Create a pack of dynamic and modular softwares to apply to the companies and use existing ones. Some of them will not want to give the decisions rights to the users, also other even will not a log of everything. In this way you can give a really simple project where the inhabitants of a town can just vote YES/NOT poll's (crappy DD) or even create forum discussions, create polls from them (or give the rights to create polls to the mayor), send the results via mail to the town people and log it in LOG...

 - Software
 Every module should work as (REST) APIs and should be a front-end module for every module. Some of them coded with just JS (much faster and secure) and the needed ones (for example SEO reasons) printed.
 	- CORE: The source of all the dinosaurs.
 		- FILE: To have control of all the files saved in the system.
 		- USER: To mantain the users, groups, roles and permissions.
 			- ROLES AND PERM: Will have control of the rights of the users/groups for the different actions.
 			- IMPORT-LINK?: To import and link existing ones. Has to be dynamic and with adaptors. With an admin to link groups or users with Modules and their actions or sub-modules. *Link is not so secure...
 	- LOG: A simple log system of any possible and instersting activity. Kinda Twitter. Where you can check and filter by categories.
 		- BLOG: A simple blog system
 	- DEMOC: Where you can take decisions. There are some different sub-modules.
 		- FORUM: Simple one.
 			- FORUM-DECISION: Where from a conversation can create an approach with the different proposal candidates to later create a poll.
		- POLL: A simple poll whit the different proposal candidates. The organisation (let's say the city hall) can enable or disable the comments inside the poll.
	- WIKI: The wiki should be the CMS per se. Can create a group of pages with some kind of theme.

 - Others
 	- Use scrum for the project
 	- Always mantain an updated documentation


*Write down the existing ideas if your idea is different or just modify the existing ones.
